I am a fourth year PhD student in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. My research interests include privacy in the Internet of Things (IoTs) and online privacy. My previous and current projects involve understanding people's perceptions and privacy/security concerns of different emerging technologies, such as drones, Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons, and smart home technologies, as well as design and build privacy-enhancing mechanisms for these technologies. I am also interested in online privacy, in particular online behavior advertising.

I received my Master of Science in Information Management from the Information School at the University of Washington in Seattle, and Bachelor of Business Administration from Harbin Institute of Technology in China.

I'm advised by [Dr. Yang Wang](http://yangwang.syr.edu), and I'm also a member of Social Computing Systems (SALT) Lab here in Syracuse University.
